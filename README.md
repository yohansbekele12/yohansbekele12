👋 Hi, I’m @yohansbekele12
👀 I’m interested in Web Development, Penetration Testing, and Cyber Security
🌱 I’m currently learning Next.js, Electron.js, Automotive Security Assessment, and fun CTFs 😉
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on MERN Stack projects, Pentesting projects, Bug Bounties, and FUN CTFs
📫 Reach me at yohanse.yohans@gmail.com
⚡ Fun fact: I fell in love with computers after hacking Windows XP using Safe Mode + CMD. Since then, computers hate me, but I still love them and continue to follow them 😆
